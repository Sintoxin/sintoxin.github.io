	<p>So I have to come up with a paragraph to take up some space below the image. That shouldn't be too hard.</p>
	<p>I'm a natural at spinning bullshit just to fill out space and make text stuff happen. I know no one will see this so it won't matter anyway, so I can say whatever I want.... I don't want to say that. I can keep to just writing about stuff in general, like thoughts about how big this paragraph should be. That'd be pretty easy to come up with. I can make it small, but i want to make sure it takes up several lines in a huge webpage. Why? I don't know. Maybe I'm thinking it would be aesthetically pleasing to me. Is that how you spell it? Whatever. I don't wanna make it just two lines sprawled across the whole thing. That sounds dumb. Granted, I would prefer to have it in a closed-in space to make it look nicer, but we're not that far in the tutorial yet. I'm surprised I can keep up with it with enough patience to get through the basic stuff I already learned a long time ago. I guess I'm just that interested in programming. Wow, this is only barely over one thousand characters. There's a lot you can fit in the discord text thingy. Message box? Yeah let's go with that. I'm using the Discord message box to fill out this huge message just to have a place to type without a popup for every word I type in Notepad++. There might be a way to turn that off, but then I won't have it when I actually would like to have it, like when I'm recalling a name of a file or element attribute. Yeah, can't wait to actually get into this, but now I'm kinda wanting to fill out the entire box message box here with 2000 characters so away I type. What else can I type about? There's a can of Glade here. I feel like Glade is a pretty bad name for an air-freshener spray, cuz it makes me think of glaze. As in the surgary syrup that hardens on the outside. Imagine, getting a can of airfresher that turns out to be a can of glaze that you're spraying on everthing. Man, that would suck. Now I'm at the end, bye!</p>
	<p>Now it's asking me to make a list. Whatever. Fine.</p>
	<p>(Fuck, my mouse died...)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Here.</li>
		<li>Have some list items.</li>
		<li>There.</li>
		<li>One more for good luck.</li>
		<li>And done. There. Where's my paycheck?</li>
	</ul>
